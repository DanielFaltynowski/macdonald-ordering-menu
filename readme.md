# MacDonald Fake Ordering Menu (by me :D)

this typo is intentional!

<br>
<br>
<br>

## Hello everyone

<br>
This is my first little project I have ever done while studying at University of Gdansk (major: Practical Computer Science)! I have tried to reproduce McDonald's ordering aplication on the screens on physical restaurants.

<br>
<br>
<br>

## How to start

<br>

It is very easy! You have to run `start.sh` file, which will automaticly run frontend, backend and database. 

<br>
<br>
<br>

## What was my motivation?

<br>
To pass the semester, duh! My project has been created as the semester project for three classes. Some functions have no sense , because I had to prove my abilities for lecturers (like cookies) and I had to do some extra functionality. Down below is a checklist, what my project includes (and works like they should).

<br>
<br>
<br>

## This boring part where I list my requirements for every class

<br>

Every lectuter have been checking it's own part of project. For example my `Web Protocoles` lecturer haven't been looking on my frontend code, but only on backend.

<br>
<br>

### Frontend Development class:

<br>

1. use Hooks builded in React like `useState`, `useEffect`, `useLayoutEffect`,

2. create Web Application which uses `React Routes`,

3. make forms with `Formik`,

4. style pages with CSS frameworks - `tailwindcss` in my case,

5. take care of `validation`,

6. create App `without console errors` (and in need to handle them),

7. make CRUD operations with `axios`,

8. use `React Redux` (I know its an archaic technology, but tell it to my lecturer),

9. style pages in mind `"Don't make me think"`,

10. create `admin mode` where only authorized employees can change data in data base and can see extra things.


<br>
<br>

### Advanced Data Bases class:

<br>

1. use advanced database like MongoDB or Neo4j - I have choosen `Neo4j`,

2. use `RestAPI` methods while coding backend,

3. include classic CRUD operations,

4. use extentions/frameworks like aggregation in MongoDB or `Neo4j APOC`.

<br>
<br>

### Web Protocoles class:

<br>

1. use `RestAPI` methods while coding backend,

2. use `pattern matching`,

3. create form where user can log in,

4. use `Cookies`,

5. make `HTTP functionality`,

6. create `TLS certificate`,

7. save important logs to a text file,

8. encrypt and decrypt passwords.
